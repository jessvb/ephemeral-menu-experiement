<!-- Pay close attention to the demographic information about users that is reported 
        in the paper, and collect the same information about your users as part of your
         experiment implementation. Similarly, pay close attention to any subjective 
         judgements that users are asked to make about the conditions, and make sure 
         that your experiment implementation collects those judgements from its users as 
         well. -->
